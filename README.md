#SARS-COV-2 Mpro conformational changes induced by covalently bound ligands

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as the etiologic agent of COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) and is responsible for the 2019 – 2020’s viral pneumonia outbreak started in Wuhan (China). Currently, there is an urgent need for the treatments against the SARS-CoV-2 infection, due to the lack of an efficient vaccine. In this sense, the research of new antivirals drugs, targeting crucial viral molecular targets, can constitute an effective treatment. SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) plays a crucial role in processing the polyprotein into mature proteins, making it a relevant drug target. Recently, several SARS-CoV-2 Mpro three-dimensional structures, co-crystallized with different ligands became available. However, our hypothesis is which we believe might be an underestimation of the ligand’s induced-fit effects. In this sense, this work discusses the influence of ligand binding in the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro dynamics and the inhibitory mechanism using molecular dynamics simulation. We hope that by bridging the gap between the static crystals and the protein dynamics one can discover new small molecules inhibitors for COVID-19 treatment.
